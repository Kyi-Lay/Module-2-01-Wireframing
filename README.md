# 🏗️ Create a Wireframe

# Activity 2: Wireframing Solved

## Explanation and Result

* I started with My header and sub-heading already defined which leaves  with the body and footer to complete.

* I move down our page to create three elements on the same row.

* When My move onto the coding phase of this mini-project you will note that we will be placing these three elements into a container. This container will determine how My elements sit on the row of.

* Inside of My row that is highlighted in red, I see a blue highlighted box which determines how elements sit on the column.

* Finally, we reached the footer of our website which is simply a blocked off area at the bottom of the page.
